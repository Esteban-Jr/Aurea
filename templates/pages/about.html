    <p class="about-paragraph">
      At <strong>AUREA</strong>, we believe that every meal should be more than just food — 
      it should be an <span class="highlight">experience</span>. Our name, AUREA, meaning “golden,” 
      reflects our commitment to creating moments that are timeless, warm, and unforgettable, 
      just like the glow of Italy’s rich culinary heritage.

    <!-- Story -->

      Our story began with a passion for Italian cuisine and a dream to bring 
      <span class="highlight">authentic flavors</span>, fresh ingredients, and the spirit of Italy 
      to our community. Inspired by the artistry of traditional recipes and the vibrancy of modern 
      dining, we built AUREA to be more than a restaurant — it’s a place where family, friends, 
      and good food come together.
